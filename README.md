The perception is a comprehensive process of the interpretation of stimuli, where researchers examine the formation of the individual in which they try to explain different theories and different approaches. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the perception of two and three dimensional shapes that have never been encountered before on long-term memory. The selected shapes are fictitious produced by the researchers conducting the experiment. The experiment consists of two stages. At the first stage shows fifteen dimensional shapes. The participants were asked if they had seen these shapes before. In the second stage, the same situation was applied in three dimensional shapes. The experiment was conducted in a computer with thirty participants. Within-subject design was used in the research. In the research, it is expected that the three-dimensional shapes will be better remembered and more successful. As a result of the findings, it was found that the two-dimensional shapes were significantly better remembered than expected.
